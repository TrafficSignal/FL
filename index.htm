<span id="infotitle"><h3>Exception List and Traffic Signal Maintaining Agencies (TSMA)  in Florida </h3> </span>
		<p><ul>
			<b>Exceptions:</b>
			<li>Only Traffic Signal Maintaining Agencies that have more than 20 interconnected signals and/or 
			more than 20 traffic signals in the State Highway System (SHS) have been mapped by TRINT.  Fifty seven TSMA are being mapped by TRINT (49 complete, 8 in process)</li>
			<li>There are over 100 Traffic Signal Maintaining Agencies/TSMA that DO NOT meet the criteria above</li>
			<br>
			<b>Clarifications in process:</b>
			<li>Only 1/3 of signals have been mapped in Jacksonville TSMA 381 (Signals) - TRINT is requesting tabular list from TSMA</li>
			<li>TRINT is requesting clarifications on 3 Traffic Signals in Lake County</li>
			<li>TRINT is requesting clarifications on 2 Traffic Signals in City of St. Petersburg</li>
			<li>TRINT is requesting clarifications on several Traffic Signals that have jurisdiction overlap City of Naples and Collier County </li>

			<br>
			<b>Data not yet obtained:</b>
			<li>Several TSMA have not been mapped that TRINT believes to have more than 20 interconnected traffic signals.  These government agencies or entities have not shared shared data with
			Transportation Intelligence/TRINT.  Trint has requested any list (even handwritten ones), forms. maps,  from such TSMAs.  Some more advanced agencies provide KML, GIS/Shape file. 
			some less advanced agencies provide a excel file, text file or PDF file. There were also a couple of TSMAs that provided a handwritten list. 
			However there are TSMA that have yet to share traffic signal information even after 30 days  (with weekly request) </li>
			<li> These TSMA are: 	Citrus County,  Putnam County, Lake City, City of Winter Haven, and  City of Clearwater</li>
			<li>Please report any data inaccuracies that you find at <a href='mailto:data@trint.us?Subject=Data%20Error'>data@trint.us</a> </li>
